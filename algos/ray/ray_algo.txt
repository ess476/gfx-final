1.1: We need to add a specular component to the lighting model.

1.2: We need the rays to reflect off of the objects they hit. We take intersection
points, and we send new 2 kinds of new rays.
	2. We use specular reflection to create new rays to other objects
	(specular inter-object reflection)
	3. We send refractive rays through transparent objects (we don't have to
	do this if the object is totally opaque).

2:
	From the textbook section 11.1
	Assuming n is normalized:
		r = -v - 2(-v * n)n
		r = -v + 2(v * n)n

3:
	The further away the light is from the object the less intense its
	contribution will be. Usually this is a non-linear function, so the
	intensity of light rapidly decreases.

4:
	1. When there is another opaque object in-front thus blocking
	the light source.

	2. The object could be self-occluding blocking light.

	Extra Credit:
	3. The object's material could be totally transparent

	4. The object's material could have 0 for all lighting coefficients
	(an infinitely dark object). 


5:
	j * w: this is the length of the full mapping.
	u * j * w: is how far into the full mapping we are.
	u * j * w % w: will map us from the repeating texture map coordinates
	in to the single texture map we have.

	(s, t) = ((u * j * w) % w, (v * k * h) % h) 	

6:
	a = ambient
	d = diffuse
	s = specular
	b = blend
	t = texture color

	I = a + ((b * t) + (1 - b)*d) + s


7: The specular exponent is a measure of how shiny the object is. The higher the
constant the shinier the object is, and the smaller and more intense the specular
highlight will be. In contrast if the specular expontent constant is small,
the specular highlight will be larger.

8.
	Path tracers bounce rays off objects probabilistically, rather than
	simply bouncing one ray from the object deterministically according
	to the reflection equation like in ray tracing. This means that Path
	tracing gives a better approximation of lighting.

	Path tracing advantages:
		1. Path tracers have more realistic lighting effects, including
		better shadows and ambient occlusion.
	Path tracing disadvantages:
		1. Noise. Lots and lots of noise. Unless the tracer has a huge number of
		rays, the image will be full of noise, especially in bright scenes.
		2. It's much slower. Since you need to probabilistically simulate a lot of
		rays if you want the image to look good.

	Other global illumination methods:
		1. Radiosity
		2. Photon mapping
		3. Path tracing
		4. Spherical Harmonics
		5. Metropolis Light Transport
